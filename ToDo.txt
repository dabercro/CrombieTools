Fix install script to check for existing installation first

Make generic MC reader and update reweighter tool (decouple from stackplotter)
    Finish UseLimitTree function in the stack plotter,
        it should change basically how GetHists behaves, nothing else
    Make xsection weight adder as well
    Clean up Limit Tree Maker
    Allow stack plotter to work without luminosity

Clean up Submission scripts
    Add Error checking for the config (Things should be filled)
    Check for running jobs and offer to kill them
    Make fresh flag in TempDir for Full, but don't remove full right away
    Somehow had empty trees from signal in Full... investigate
        This came from empty Nero directories. Fix this.

Add check for existing output file into FlatSkimmer itself
Test Parallelization.py and remove CrombieFlatSkimmer

Error handling in LimitTreeMaker

For plots in cutflow:
    Add multiple lines for other files, can watch MC that way
    Adjust to use triggers
